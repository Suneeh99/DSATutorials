# FIFO Queue Implementation Using Two Stacks

- **Concept**: A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue can be implemented using two stacks.
- **Methods**: There are two primary approaches to implement this structure, each optimizing either the enqueue or dequeue operation.

### Method 1 (Dequeue-Friendly)

- **Description**: In this approach, **dequeue operations are efficient** while **enqueue operations are more costly**.
- **Process**:
  - **Enqueue**:
    - If the dequeue stack is empty, push the new element directly onto it.
    - Otherwise, move all elements from the dequeue stack to the enqueue stack, then push the new element onto the dequeue stack, and finally move all elements back from the enqueue stack.
  - **Dequeue**:
    - Simply pop the element from the dequeue stack if it is not empty.
    - If both stacks are empty, return `-1`, indicating the queue is empty.

### Method 2 (Enqueue-Friendly)

- **Description**: In this approach, **enqueue operations are efficient** while **dequeue operations are more costly**.
- **Process**:
  - **Enqueue**:
    - Push the new element directly onto the enqueue stack.
  - **Dequeue**:
    - If the dequeue stack is empty, move all elements from the enqueue stack to the dequeue stack.
    - Pop the top element from the dequeue stack.
    - If both stacks are empty, return `-1`, indicating an empty queue.

# FIFO Queue Implementation Using an Array

- **Concept**: A queue implemented with an array utilizes **front** and **rear** pointers to manage elements.
- **Initial Setup**:
  - Both `front` and `rear` pointers start at `-1`.

### Enqueue Operation

- **Process**:
  - Increment the `rear` pointer by `1`.
  - Insert the new element at the index indicated by the `rear`.
  - If the queue is initially empty, set both `front` and `rear` to `0`.
  - If the `rear` pointer reaches the end of the array (`size - 1`), further enqueue operations cannot be performed (queue is full).

```csharp
void Enqueue(int n) {
    if (IsFull()) {
        // Queue is full, handle as needed
    } else {
        rear++;
        arr[rear] = n;
    }
}
```

### Dequeue Operation

- **Process**:
  - Retrieve the element at the `front` index.
  - Increment the `front` pointer by `1`.
  - If the queue becomes empty after dequeueing, reset both `front` and `rear` pointers to `-1` to indicate an empty queue.
  - Ensure the queue is not empty before dequeueing.

```csharp
void Dequeue() {
    if (IsEmpty()) {
        // Queue is empty, handle as needed
    } else {
        // Process dequeuing
        if (rear == -1 && front == -1 && front == size) {
            // Queue is empty
        } else {
            // Dequeue logic here
        }
    }
}
```

### Limitations of Array-Based FIFO Queue

- **Linear Structure**:
  - Once full, the queue cannot accept additional elements, even if space becomes available after dequeuing.
- **Space Efficiency**:
  - Space may be wasted at the start of the array as elements are dequeued.
- **Flexibility**:
  - Adheres to strict FIFO order, which may not suit scenarios needing flexible element removal.

# Circular Queue

- **Concept**: A circular queue connects the first and last elements, forming a circular structure.
- **Initial Setup**:
  - Both `front` and `rear` pointers start at `-1`.

### Full Queue Condition

- The circular queue is considered full when either:
  - `(rear == size - 1) && (front == 0)`
  - `(rear == front - 1)`

### Operations in a Circular Queue

1. **enQueue(value)**:
   - Inserts a new value at the end of the queue.
   - If the queue is empty, set both `front` and `rear` to `0`.
   - If the `rear` pointer reaches the end of the queue, wrap it around to `0`.
   - Increment `rear` for the next insertion.

2. **deQueue()**:
   - Removes the element at the `front` of the queue.
   - If `front` equals `rear`, reset both pointers to `-1` (indicating an empty queue).
   - If the `front` pointer reaches the end, wrap it around to `0`.
   - Increment `front` for the next removal.

3. **Peek()**:
   - Returns the value at `front` without removing it.

4. **IsEmpty()**:
   - Checks if both `front` and `rear` are `-1`.

5. **IsFull()**:
   - Checks if the circular queue is full based on the conditions mentioned above.

# FIFO Queue Implementation Using Two Stack

- A queue can be implemented by using two stacks
- there are two methods

1. **Method 1  ( Dequeque friendly )**

- Enqueue operations is costly and dequeue operations are efficient.
- Steps
	- While the enqueue stack is empty, push the element to stack dequeue stack
	- else, push all the elements from enqueue stack to dequeue stack, and push the element to the top of the enqueue stack

- If the stack is empty , return -1
- 


- When dequeue is empty -> push the new element to dequeue stack
- Step 1 - Pop all the elements from enqueue stack and push them into Dequeue Operation

## 2. Method 2 ( Enqueue Friendly )

- In this method Dequeue Operations are costly while Enqueue operations are Friendly.

### Enqueue Operations
Step 1 : 
	When enqueuing an element, simply push the new element onto enqueue stack.

![Pasted image 20241025084635](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/673828d3-8c1e-4d29-a24c-58687b9659d1)

### Dequeue Operation
Step 1 : 
	If Enqueue Stack and dequeue stack are empty, return -1 as there is no element

# FIFO Queue Implementation using an array

- In array they have front and rear
- need to be -1 front and rear

- Enqueue Operation
	- increment the rear point by 1
	- insert the new element at the index indicated by the rear pointer
	- if the queue is empty, set both first and rear pointers to 0 after enqueuing the first element.
	- If the rear pointer reaches the size of the array minus one, the enqueue operation cannot be performed

````cs
Enqueue(int n){
	if(IsFull()){
	}
	else {
		R++;
		arr[R] = n;
	}
}
`````

- Is F and R is 


```cs
Dequeue(){
	if(IsEmpty()){
		
	} else {
		if (R == -1 and F == -1 and F = size){
		}else {
		}
	}
}
```


### Dequeue Operations 
- Retireve the element at the index indicated by the front pointer and then increament the front pointer by one.
- if queue is empty after dequeuing, reset bioth froint and rear pointer to -1 to indicate an empty
- ensure that the queue is not empty before the perfoming the dequeue operation


## Limitations of FIFO Operations

- Linear Structure
	- FiFO Queue have a linear strcuture, meaning that once the queue is full, it cannot accept any more elements even if there are empty slots available after dequeuing some elements
- Space Efficiency
	- There might be wasted space at the beginning of the array where elements have been dequeued.
- Flexibility 
	- FIFO queues have a strict first-in-first-out policy which might not be suitable for all scenarios 
	- Once added mistakenly it cannot be removed until is the next processing elements

# Circular Queue

- first and last element connected to each other representing circle
- initial point R and F values are -1
- 

- If circular queue is full it will satisfied below conditions

	- `Size - 1 = R then F = 0`
	- `if( R == F-1 )
	
	
## Operations in Circular Queue

- enQueue(Value) : used to insert new value to the queue. it will added end of the queue
- deQueeu() : uised to remove value of the queue. this happen in front of the queeu
- Peek() : reqturen the values without removing it
- IsEmpty()
- IsFull()
