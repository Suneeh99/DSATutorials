# **AVL Trees**

An **AVL Tree** is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) where the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees for every node (called the **balance factor**) is -1, 0, or 1.  
The balance factor is calculated as:  
**Balance Factor = Height of Left Subtree - Height of Right Subtree**

### **Why AVL Trees?**

- Ensures that the height of the tree remains logarithmic.
- Guarantees efficient operations like search, insertion, and deletion in **O(log n)** time.

## **AVL Rotations**

If the balance factor of any node becomes less than -1 or greater than 1, we perform rotations to rebalance the tree. There are **four types of rotations**:

### **1. Left-Left (LL) Rotation**

Occurs when a node is inserted in the left subtree of the left child.

#### Example:

```plaintext
       A
      /
     B
    /
   C
After LL Rotation:
       B
      / \
     C   A
```

### **2. Right-Right (RR) Rotation**

Occurs when a node is inserted in the right subtree of the right child.

#### Example:

```plaintext
       A
        \
         B
          \
           C
After RR Rotation:
       B
      / \
     A   C
```

### **3. Left-Right (LR) Rotation**

Occurs when a node is inserted in the right subtree of the left child. This is a **double rotation**:

1. Perform RR Rotation on the left child.
2. Perform LL Rotation on the node.

#### Example:

```plaintext
       A
      /
     B
      \
       C
After LR Rotation:
       C
      / \
     B   A
```

### **4. Right-Left (RL) Rotation**

Occurs when a node is inserted in the left subtree of the right child. This is a **double rotation**:

1. Perform LL Rotation on the right child.
2. Perform RR Rotation on the node.

#### Example:

```plaintext
       A
        \
         B
        /
       C
After RL Rotation:
       C
      / \
     A   B
```

## **Insertion in AVL Tree**

- Insert the node as in a normal binary search tree (BST).
- Trace back to the root and update the balance factors.
- Perform the required rotation(s) if a node becomes unbalanced.

---

## **Deletion in AVL Tree**

- Delete the node as in a normal BST.
- Trace back to the root and update the balance factors.
- Perform the required rotation(s) if a node becomes unbalanced.

## **Examples of Insertions and Deletions**

### **Example 1: Insertions**

Sequence: `10, 20, 30, 25, 27, 7, 4, 23, 26, 21`

1. **Insert 10:**
    
    ```plaintext
        10
    ```
    
2. **Insert 20:**
    
    ```plaintext
        10
          \
          20
    ```
    
3. **Insert 30 (RR Rotation):**
    
    ```plaintext
        20
       /  \
      10  30
    ```
    
4. **Insert 25:**
    
    ```plaintext
        20
       /  \
      10  30
          /
         25
    ```
    
5. **Insert 27 (RL Rotation):**
    
    ```plaintext
        20
       /  \
      10  27
          /  \
        25   30
    ```
    
6. Continue with insertions for `7, 4, 23, 26, 21`, balancing the tree after each step.

### **Example 2: Deletions**

Initial Tree:

```plaintext
       20
      /  \
     15  30
    / \    \
   10 18   40
  /   /
 5   17
```

1. **Delete 18:**
    
    ```plaintext
        20
       /  \
      15  30
     / \    \
    10 17   40
    ```
    

2. **Delete 30:**  

````plaintext
    20
   /  \
  15  40
 / \    
10 17    
/   
5   
````

3. Balance the tree by rotations if needed.

### **Practice Exercise**

Sequence: `21, 26, 30, 9, 4, 14, 28, 18, 15, 10, 2, 3, 7`

Construct an AVL Tree step-by-step and balance it after each insertion.

## **Key Takeaways**

- AVL Trees ensure balance and efficiency for search, insertion, and deletion.
- Rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL) restore balance when the tree becomes unbalanced.
- Practice building AVL trees to better understand their behavior.
