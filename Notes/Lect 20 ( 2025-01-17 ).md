# Walk, Trails and Paths-2

1. **Eulerian Walk:**
    
    - An **Eulerian Walk** is a path that visits every edge in a graph **exactly once**. It may not necessarily be a closed path.
2. **Trail:**
    
    - A **Trail** is a path in which no edge is repeated, but it may revisit vertices.
3. **Circuit:**
    
    - A **Circuit** is a closed **trail**, meaning it starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating any edges.
4. **Eulerian Trail:**
    
    - An **Eulerian Trail** traverses every edge **exactly once**, but it does not necessarily start and end at the same vertex.
    - It may visit vertices multiple times.

### **Eulerian Trail and Eulerian Circuit**

1. **Eulerian Trail:**
    
    - A **Eulerian Trail** traverses every edge in the graph exactly once.
        - It **may** visit a vertex more than once.
        - It **may not be closed** (i.e., it may not return to the starting vertex).
2. **Eulerian Circuit:**
    
    - An **Eulerian Circuit** is a closed Eulerian Trail. It starts and ends at the same vertex, and it traverses every edge exactly once.

### **Types of Eulerian Graphs**

1. **Eulerian Graph:**
    
    - A graph that has an **Eulerian Circuit**. This means every vertex has an **even degree** (an even number of edges connected to it).
2. **Semi-Eulerian Graph:**
    
    - A **Semi-Eulerian Graph** is a graph that contains an **Eulerian Trail** but not necessarily an Eulerian Circuit.
    - It must have exactly **two vertices with odd degrees**, while the rest have even degrees.
3. **Non-Eulerian Graph:**
    
    - A graph that is **neither Eulerian nor Semi-Eulerian**. This means it is not possible to traverse every edge exactly once in any path.
    - A graph is non-Eulerian if it has **more than two vertices with odd degrees**.

### **Criteria for Eulerian Graphs**

1. **Eulerian Graph:** All vertices should have **even degrees**.
    
2. **Semi-Eulerian Graph:** The graph has **exactly two vertices with odd degrees**.
    
3. **Non-Eulerian Graph:** If there are **more than two vertices with odd degrees**, the graph is non-Eulerian.

### **Eulerian Graph in Directed Graphs**

1. **Eulerian Graph (Directed):**
    
    - For a directed graph to be Eulerian, every vertex should have the same **in-degree** (number of edges coming into the vertex) as **out-degree** (number of edges going out of the vertex).
2. **Semi-Eulerian Graph (Directed):**
    
    - A directed graph is **Semi-Eulerian** if it contains an **Eulerian Trail** (i.e., it has exactly one vertex with one more outgoing edge than incoming edges and one vertex with one more incoming edge than outgoing edges).

### **Bridge or Cut Edge**

A **bridge** (or **cut edge**) is an edge in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In other words, removing a bridge disconnects the graph.

### **Fleury’s Algorithm (Finding Eulerian Circuit)**

Fleury’s algorithm can be used to find an Eulerian Circuit in a connected graph where every vertex has an even degree.

**Steps of Fleury's Algorithm:**

1. Start at any vertex.
2. Follow an edge to another vertex, making sure not to remove a bridge unless there are no other choices.
3. Mark edges as visited when you traverse them.
4. Repeat until all edges are visited and you return to the starting vertex.

**Example:**

- In the graph provided (C-D-H-E-G-F-D-A-B-C), Fleury’s algorithm will follow edges, avoiding bridges as much as possible, until all edges are traversed, forming an Eulerian Circuit.

### **Shortest Path Problem**

1. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:**
    
    - **Dijkstra's Algorithm** is used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph.
    - It works for graphs with **non-negative weights** on edges.
    - The basic idea is to repeatedly select the vertex with the smallest tentative distance and update its neighbors' distances.
2. **Steps of Dijkstra’s Algorithm:**
    
    1. Mark the starting vertex with a distance of 0 and all others with infinity.
    2. For the current vertex, update the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.
    3. Move to the vertex with the smallest distance and repeat the process.
    4. Continue until the shortest paths to all vertices are found.

### **Summary of Graph Types and Walks**

- **Eulerian Graph:** All vertices have even degrees; it has an Eulerian Circuit.
- **Semi-Eulerian Graph:** Exactly two vertices have odd degrees; it has an Eulerian Trail.
- **Non-Eulerian Graph:** More than two vertices have odd degrees, and no Eulerian walk is possible.
