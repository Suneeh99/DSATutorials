# Steque

- **Definition**: A "steque" (stack-ended queue) is a hybrid data structure that combines the properties of a stack and a queue.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Supports three primary operations: `push`, `pop`, and `enqueue`.
  - **One end is used to enqueue** elements (queue behavior).
  - The **opposite end operates as a stack**, where elements can be pushed or popped.

### Operations in a Steque

1. **Push**:
   - Adds an element to the **top** of the steque.
   - After a push, the newly added element is at the **front** of the steque.

2. **Pop**:
   - Removes and returns the element at the **top** of the steque.
   - After popping, the element directly below becomes the new front.

3. **Enqueue**:
   - Adds an element to the **end** of the steque.
   - The newly added element becomes the **rear** of the steque.

4. **Peek**:
   - Returns the front elementâ€™s value without removing it from the steque.

#### Operations Illustration

- **Push Operation**:
  - Adds an element to the front, shifting all other elements back in position (stack behavior).
  
- **Pop Operation**:
  - Removes the front element, allowing access to the next element in the stack.

- **Enqueue Operation**:
  - Adds an element to the rear of the steque, preserving queue functionality for insertion.

# Insertion Sort

- **Description**: Insertion sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm, often used for sorting small arrays or arrays that are nearly sorted.
- **Working Mechanism**:
  - The array is divided into a **sorted** part and an **unsorted** part.
  - Each element from the unsorted part is picked and **inserted into its correct position** in the sorted part.
  - This process mimics arranging playing cards by inserting each card into its correct spot among the previously sorted cards.

### Steps of Insertion Sort

1. **Initial Comparison**:
   - Start with the first two elements (`data[0]` and `data[1]`).
   - If these elements are out of order, they are swapped.

2. **Sequential Insertion**:
   - The next element from the unsorted portion is selected and inserted into the correct position within the sorted part.
   - If this element is smaller than one or more elements in the sorted section, each larger element is **shifted one position to the right** to make room.

3. **Repeat Until Sorted**:
   - Continue this process for each element until the entire array is sorted.

### When to Use Insertion Sort

- **Small Number of Elements**: Insertion sort is efficient when the dataset is small due to its minimal overhead.
- **Nearly Sorted Arrays**: This sort works well on arrays that are nearly sorted, as fewer swaps are needed.
- **Few Misplaced Elements in Large Arrays**: It is also effective when only a few elements are out of order in an otherwise sorted array.

### Insertion Sort Algorithm

1. **Iterate**: Loop from `arr[1]` to `arr[N-1]` over the array.
2. **Compare**: Compare each element to its previous values in the sorted portion.
3. **Shift**: If the current element (key) is smaller, shift each larger element one position up to make space.
4. **Insert**: Place the key element in its correct position.

### Example Code

The following Java code demonstrates the insertion sort in action:

```java
int arr[] = { 8, 5, 1, 2, 9 };
for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++){
    int key = arr[i];
    int j = i - 1;

    // Shift elements of arr[0..i-1] that are greater than key
    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
        arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
        j = j - 1;
    }
    arr[j + 1] = key;
}
```

example with swap method ( higher running time than above method)

```java
int[] arr = {8, 5, 1, 2, 9}; 
for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) { 
	int j = i; // Swap until the current element is in the correct position 
	while (j > 0 && arr[j - 1] > arr[j]) { // Swap arr[j] and arr[j - 1] 
		int temp = arr[j]; 
		arr[j] = arr[j - 1]; 
		arr[j - 1] = temp; 
		j--; 
	} 
}
```
### Complexity of Insertion Sort

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: \( O(n) \) when the array is already sorted.
  - **Average and Worst Case**: \( O(n^2) \) due to the nested loop for each insertion.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \), as it sorts in place without requiring extra memory.

### Summary

- **Steque**: Combines stack and queue functionalities, allowing push and pop from one end and enqueue at the other.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm ideal for small or nearly sorted arrays, using an insertion-based approach to achieve sorted order.
