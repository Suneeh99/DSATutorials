# Optimization in Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a basic sorting algorithm but is often inefficient for large arrays due to repeated comparisons and swaps. Optimizations can make it more efficient, especially when the array is nearly sorted.

### 1. Optimization by Flag

- **Concept**: Use a **boolean flag** to track if any swaps occurred during an iteration. If no swaps were made, the array is already sorted, and we can end the process early.
- **Process**:
  1. Initialize a `swapped` flag as `false` at the start of each outer loop.
  2. During each inner loop, set `swapped` to `true` if any two elements are swapped.
  3. After the inner loop, if `swapped` remains `false`, end the sorting process because the array is already sorted.
- **Benefit**: This prevents unnecessary iterations, particularly in nearly sorted arrays, reducing time complexity.

#### Code Example (Java)

```java
public class BubbleSortWithFlag {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {5, 1, 4, 2, 8};
        boolean swapped;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            swapped = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < arr.length - 1 - i; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }
            if (!swapped) break;
        }

        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Optimization by Count

- **Concept**: This optimization reduces the range of the inner loop after each pass, as the largest unsorted element is already in its correct position at the end.
- **Process**:
  1. Track the number of iterations to control the range of comparisons.
  2. After each pass, reduce the inner loop range by one since the last element in the unsorted part is sorted.
- **Benefit**: By reducing the number of comparisons after each pass, we avoid redundant checks and improve efficiency.

#### Code Example (Java)

```java
public class BubbleSortWithCount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {5, 1, 4, 2, 8};

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < arr.length - 1 - i; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }

        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

# Loop Invariant for Insertion Sort

- **Loop Invariant**: A concept used in insertion sort to show that, at the start of each loop iteration, the subarray before the current index `i` is sorted.
- **Explanation**:
  - Before each iteration, the subarray `A[0, i-1]` is sorted.
  - Elements `A[i+1..n-1]` are unsorted.

### Key Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - At the first loop iteration, `j = 2`, and the subarray `A[1...j-1]` (only one element) is sorted.

2. **Maintenance**:
   - In the inner loop, elements in positions `A[j-1], A[j-2]` are shifted right until the correct position for `key` (value initially in `A[j]`) is found.
   - The value of `key` is then placed in this position, maintaining the sorted order of the subarray.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop ends when `j = n + 1` (meaning the array has been sorted).
   - Thus, the full array `A[0..n-1]` is sorted.

# Priority Queue - Insertion and Deletion

## Enqueue Friendly (Adding Efficiently)

- **Enqueue**: Simple and efficient; a new element is appended to the end of the queue without sorting.
  
  ```plaintext
  Example: [7] --> [11, 9, 4, 8] --> [7, 11, 9, 4, 8]
  ```

- **Dequeue**:
  - **Step 1**: Find the highest priority element in the queue.
  - **Step 2**: Remove that element from the queue.

## Dequeue Friendly (Removing Efficiently)

- **Dequeue**: Efficient; remove the element at the front of the queue, which has the highest priority.
  
- **Enqueue**:
  - Insert the new element in the correct position to keep the order intact.
  - Compare the new element with existing elements until it reaches the correct position.
