# **Graphs in Data Structures**

A **graph** is a collection of **vertices (nodes)** and **edges** that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs are used to represent networks, such as road networks, social connections, and much more.

#### **Key Concepts**

1. **Vertices (Nodes):**
    
    - A **vertex** is a point or a node in the graph. It represents an entity like a person, place, or object.
2. **Edges:**
    
    - An **edge** connects two vertices. It represents the relationship or path between those two vertices.
    - **Directed Edges**: These edges have a direction, meaning you can only travel from one vertex to the other in a specific direction.
    - **Undirected Edges**: These edges don’t have a direction, meaning you can travel in both directions between the vertices.

### **Types of Graphs**

1. **Directed Graph (Digraph):**
    
    - In a **directed graph**, edges have a direction. You can only travel from one vertex to another if there’s a directed edge from the starting vertex to the destination vertex.
    - Example: Social media connections (following someone).
2. **Undirected Graph:**
    
    - In an **undirected graph**, the edges have no direction. You can travel in both directions between the vertices.
    - Example: A friendship network (both people are friends).

### **Graph Terminology**

1. **Degree of a Vertex:**
    
    - The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.
        - **In-degree**: The number of edges entering a vertex (in directed graphs).
        - **Out-degree**: The number of edges leaving a vertex (in directed graphs).
2. **Isolated Vertex:**
    
    - A **vertex** is **isolated** if it has no edges connected to it.
3. **Leaf Vertex:**
    
    - A **leaf vertex** is a vertex that has only one edge connected to it. It often appears at the end of a tree structure.
4. **Out-degree:**
    
    - **Out-degree** refers to the number of outgoing edges from a vertex in a directed graph.

### **Graph Representation**

Graphs can be represented in several ways, but one of the simplest methods is the **Edge List**.

1. **Edge List:**
    - An **edge list** is a list of all the edges in the graph. Each edge is represented as a pair of vertices it connects.
        - Example: For a graph with edges connecting A to B and B to C, the edge list would look like this:
            
            ```
            [(A, B), (B, C)]
            ```

### **Applications of Graphs**

- **Social Networks:** Representing connections between people (friends, followers).
- **Routing Algorithms:** Representing cities and roads for shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra’s or A*.
- **Web Page Links:** Representing links between web pages for search engine ranking.
- **Network Topologies:** Representing computer networks.
