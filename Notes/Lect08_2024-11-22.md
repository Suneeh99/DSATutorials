## Doubly Linked List

A **doubly linked list** is a type of linked list where each node is connected to the next and the previous node.

### Structure of a Node:

- Each node has three parts:
    1. **Data**: Stores the actual value.
    2. **Next**: Points to the next node.
    3. **Prev**: Points to the previous node.

### Example:

```md
| Data |        | Data |
| Prev | -----> | Prev |
| Next | <----- | Next |
Node1             Node2

Node2 = Node1.Next
Node1 = Node2.Prev
```

You can move both forward (using `Next`) and backward (using `Prev`) in the list.

### Operations in a Doubly Linked List:

#### 1. **Insertion**

You can insert nodes at different positions:

- **At the beginning**:
    
    - Create a new node.
    - Set the new node’s `Next` to the current head.
    - Set the current head’s `Prev` to the new node.
    - Update the head to the new node.
    - Example:
        
        ```text
        New Node → Old Head → ...
        ```
        
- **At the end**:
    
    - Create a new node.
    - Traverse to the last node.
    - Set the last node’s `Next` to the new node.
    - Set the new node’s `Prev` to the last node.
    - Update the tail to the new node.
    - Example:
        
        ```text
        ... → Old Tail → New Node
        ```
        
- **After a specific node**:
    
    - Create a new node.
    - Find the target node.
    - Set the new node’s `Next` to the target node’s `Next`.
    - Set the new node’s `Prev` to the target node.
    - Update the target node’s `Next` and the next node’s `Prev` to point to the new node.

#### 2. **Deletion**

You can delete nodes from:

- **The beginning**:
    
    - Move the head to the next node.
    - Set the new head’s `Prev` to `NULL`.
    - Delete the old head.
- **The end**:
    
    - Traverse to the last node.
    - Update the second-last node’s `Next` to `NULL`.
    - Delete the last node.
- **A specific position**:
    
    - Find the node to delete.
    - Update the previous node’s `Next` to point to the next node.
    - Update the next node’s `Prev` to point to the previous node.
    - Delete the node.

#### 3. **Traversal**

- **Forward traversal**:
    - Start at the head.
    - Visit each node using the `Next` pointer.
- **Backward traversal**:
    - Start at the tail.
    - Visit each node using the `Prev` pointer.

### Variations of Linked Lists:

#### **Circular Singly Linked List**:

- The last node connects back to the first node, forming a circle.
- No `NULL` pointers in the list.
- Example:
    
    ```text
    Node1 → Node2 → Node3 → Node1 (again)
    ```

### Example Use Case:

Imagine a playlist of songs.

- **Forward traversal**: Moving to the next song.
- **Backward traversal**: Going back to the previous song.
- **Circular linked list**: When the playlist loops from the last song back to the first song.
