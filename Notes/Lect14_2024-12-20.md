## Tree Representation of Mathematical Expressions

### Mathematical Expression Trees

Mathematical expressions can be represented as binary trees. Each node in the tree represents either an operand (e.g., variables or constants) or an operator (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). There are three common notations for representing expressions: prefix, infix, and postfix.

### Types of Notation

1. **Prefix Notation** (also known as Polish notation):
    
    - Format: `root -> left -> right`
    - Operators precede their operands.
    - Example: `+ 2 4` (equivalent to `2 + 4` in infix).
2. **Infix Notation**:
    
    - Format: `left -> root -> right`
    - Operators are placed between their operands.
    - Example: `2 + 4` (standard mathematical notation).
3. **Postfix Notation** (also known as Reverse Polish notation):
    
    - Format: `left -> right -> root`
    - Operators follow their operands.
    - Example: `2 4 +` (equivalent to `2 + 4` in infix).

### Transforming Expressions into Trees

Consider the expression `A + B * C + D`:

1. **Infix**: `A + B * C + D`
2. **Prefix**: `+ + A * B C D`
3. **Postfix**: `A B C * + D +`

This is represented as a tree structure:

```
        +
       / \
      +   D
     / \
    A   *
       / \
      B   C
```

### Example 1: Expression with Nested Operations

**Expression**: `A * B + C * D`

- Postfix for sub-expressions:
    
    - `E = A * B`: Post-order: `A B *`, Pre-order: `* A B`
    - `F = C * D`: Post-order: `C D *`, Pre-order: `* C D`
- Final Postfix: `A B * C D * +`
    
- Final Prefix: `+ * A B * C D`
    

Tree representation:

```
       +
      / \
     *   *
    / \ / \
   A  B C  D
```

---

### Example 2: Expression with Multiple Additions

**Expression**: `A + B + C + D`

- Postfix: `A B C D + + +`
- Prefix: `+ + + A B C D`

Tree representation:

```
        +
       / \
      +   D
     / \
    +   C
   / \
  A   B
```

---

### Example 3: Expression with Subtraction and Addition

**Expression**: `E - F`

- Sub-expression `E = 3 + 4`:
    - Post-order: `3 4 +`
    - Pre-order: `+ 3 4`
- Sub-expression `F = 2 + 5`:
    - Post-order: `2 5 +`
    - Pre-order: `+ 2 5`

Final postfix: `3 4 + 2 5 + -` Final prefix: `- + 3 4 + 2 5`

Tree representation:

```
    -
   / \
  +   +
 / \ / \
3  4 2  5
```

---

### Example 4: Expression with Division and Parentheses

**Expression**: `2 - 3 / (5 + 2) + 1`

- Sub-expression `A = (5 + 2)`:
    
    - Post-order: `5 2 +`
    - Pre-order: `+ 5 2`
- Sub-expression `B = 3 / A`:
    
    - Post-order: `3 5 2 + /`
    - Pre-order: `/ 3 + 5 2`

Final postfix: `2 3 5 2 + / - 1 +` Final prefix: `+ - 2 / 3 + 5 2 1`

Tree representation:

```
       +
      / \
     -   1
    / \
   2   /
      / \
     3   +
        / \
       5   2
```

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a binary tree with the following properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.

### BST Operations

1. **Finding a Node**:
    
    - Start from the root and recursively or iteratively search the left or right subtree based on the value to be found.
    
    Example:
    
    ```md
        10
       /  \
      5   30
    /  \
    ```
    

2 8

```
 To find node with value `2`, start from `10`, go to `5`, and then go to `2`.

2. **Insertion**:
 - Compare the value to be inserted with the current node's value.
 - If smaller, move to the left subtree; if greater, move to the right.
 - Repeat this process recursively until an empty spot is found.

 Example:
 Insert `7` in the tree:
 ```md
     10
    /  \
   5   30
 /  \
2   8
    /
   7
```

3. **Deletion**:
    - If the node is a leaf, simply remove it.
    - If the node has one child, replace it with its child.
    - If the node has two children, replace it with the smallest value from the right subtree or the largest from the left subtree.

## AVL Tree

An **AVL Tree** is a self-balancing binary search tree. It maintains efficient search operations by ensuring that the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by no more than one.

### Balance Factor

The **balance factor** of a node is defined as the height of its left subtree minus the height of its right subtree.

- Balance Factor = `Height(left subtree) - Height(right subtree)`

If the balance factor is `+1`, `0`, or `-1`, the tree is balanced. If it is outside this range (i.e., `> 1` or `< -1`), a rotation is needed.

### Rotations

1. **Single Rotation**:
    
    - Used when the tree is unbalanced on one side.
    - Left or Right rotations are performed based on the imbalance.
2. **Double Rotation**:
    
    - Used when the tree is unbalanced on both sides.
    - A combination of two single rotations is applied.

### Height and Nodes in AVL Trees

- The maximum number of nodes at level `r` is `2^r`.
- An AVL tree ensures that the height of the tree remains logarithmic in relation to the number of nodes.

---

### Example of AVL Tree Balancing:

Insertions and deletions in an AVL tree are followed by checks and rotations to maintain balance. For instance, if the balance factor becomes `2` or `-2` after an insertion, a rotation is applied to restore balance.
