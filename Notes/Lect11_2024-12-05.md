# **Implementing a Stack Using a Linked List**

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.

#### **Stack Operations**

1. **`push()`**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    
    - In a linked list, this is implemented by inserting a new node at the beginning.
2. **`pop()`**: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
    
    - In a linked list, this is implemented by deleting the node at the beginning.

#### **Adding an Element to the Middle**

This is not a standard stack operation but can be implemented by traversing to the middle position and inserting a node.

### **Tree**

A **tree** is a non-linear data structure used to represent hierarchical relationships.

#### **Key Features**

- **Nodes**: Used to store data or objects.
- **Root**: The topmost node of the tree.
- **Leaves**: Nodes without children.
- **Branches**: Connections between nodes.
- **Path**: The sequence of nodes from one node to another.

---

#### **Rooted Tree**

A tree where:

1. There is a single **root** node.
2. Each node has a variable number of references to child nodes.
3. Every node (except the root) has exactly one parent node.

---

### **Tree Terminology**

1. **Degree of a Node**: The number of child nodes a node has.
2. **Path**: A sequence of nodes connected by edges.
3. **Depth**: The length of the path from the root to a given node.
4. **Height**: The maximum depth of any node in the tree.
    - **Height = 0**: Only the root node exists.
    - **Height = -1**: The tree is empty.
5. **Ancestor**: A node that appears before another node in the path from the root.
6. **Descendant**: A node that appears after another node in the path from the root.

### **Abstract Trees**

An abstract tree is implemented using a class that:

- Stores a value in each node.
- Maintains children in a linked list.

### **Why Use Trees?**

1. **Organizing Data**: Trees organize data objects based on keys or hierarchical relationships (e.g., family trees).
2. **Efficient Algorithms**: Trees support faster algorithms compared to linear data structures.  
    Applications include:
    - File systems (e.g., Unix, Windows).
    - Syntax validation in compilers (syntax trees).
    - Binary Search Trees (BST) for quick lookups.
    - Self-balancing trees (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Trees) for efficient operations.

### **Types of Trees**

1. **General Tree**: Each node can have any number of children.
2. **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
3. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree designed for quick lookups.
4. **Self-Balancing Trees**:
    - **AVL Trees**: Ensure the height difference between subtrees is minimal.
    - **Red-Black Trees**: Maintain balance using color properties.

### **Basic Terminology**

- **Tree**: A non-empty collection of vertices (nodes) and edges.
- **Vertex**: A node that can carry information.
- **Path**: A sequence of distinct vertices connected by edges.

### **Applications of Trees**

- **File Systems**: Trees or tree-like structures organize files.
- **Compilers**: Syntax trees validate programming syntax.
- **Binary Search Trees**: Used for database indexing and efficient searching.
