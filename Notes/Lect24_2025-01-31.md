# **Recursive Definitions**

- There are many programming concepts that **define themselves** in terms of themselves.
- Formal restrictions such as **existence** and **uniqueness** are satisfied, and no rules are violated in the process.
- These kinds of definitions, where the concept refers to itself in some manner, are known as **recursive definitions**.

### **The Implementation of Recursion**

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller sub-problems of the original problem. It’s a fundamental programming concept, and we can implement it in several different ways, including **direct recursion**, **tail recursion**, and **indirect recursion**.

#### **Direct Recursion**

- **Direct recursion** occurs when a function calls itself **within the same function**.
- The function will continue to call itself until it reaches a **base case**, at which point it stops.

**Example of Direct Recursion (Factorial):**

```java
fac(n) {
    if (n == 1) {
        return n;
    }
    return n * fac(n - 1);
}
```

Here, the function `fac` calls itself with `n-1` until it reaches the base case `n == 1`.

#### **Tail Recursion**

- **Tail recursion** occurs when the recursive call is the **last operation** before the function returns a value.
- In **tail recursion**, there is no need to store the previous state because the result of the recursive call is directly returned.
- Tail recursion is often more **efficient** because some programming languages or compilers can optimize it using **tail call optimization**.

**Example of Tail Recursion (Factorial):**

```java
fac(n, a) {
    if (n == 1) {
        return a;
    }
    return fac(n - 1, a * n);
}
```

In this version, the function `fac` calls itself with the current result stored in `a`. This eliminates the need to keep track of intermediate results.

#### **Non-Tail Recursion**

- **Non-tail recursion** occurs when a recursive call happens but there’s additional work to do after the recursive call returns.
- The **state** of the function is saved before the recursive call and resumed after it returns.

**Example of Non-Tail Recursion:**

```java
fac(n) {
    if (n == 1) {
        return n;
    }
    return n * fac(n - 1);  // Work still needed after the call
}
```

Here, after the recursive call `fac(n-1)`, the multiplication with `n` still needs to be done after the function returns.

#### **Iterative Example (Fibonacci):**

Using iteration instead of recursion to calculate Fibonacci numbers:

```java
int a = 0;
int b = 1;

for (int n; n > 0; n--) {
    if (n == 0)
        return a;
    if (n == 1)
        return b;
    a = b;
    b = a + b;
}
```

This is an iterative solution to the Fibonacci sequence, which avoids recursion but is functionally equivalent.

---

### **Indirect Recursion**

- **Indirect recursion** happens when a function **calls another function**, which then calls the original function, creating a cycle of calls between the two functions.
- This can occur across several functions, forming a chain of calls.

**Example of Indirect Recursion:**

```java
f() {
    g();
}

g() {
    f();
}
```

In this case, function `f` calls function `g`, and `g` calls `f`, leading to indirect recursion.

---

### **Nested Recursion**

- **Nested recursion** occurs when a function calls itself **directly** or **indirectly**, and the argument to the recursive call is itself the result of another recursive call.
- It’s recursion within recursion, where each recursive call is dependent on another recursive call.

**Example of Nested Recursion:**

```java
f(n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return f(f(n-1));  // Nested recursion
}
```

In this example, the function `f(n)` makes a recursive call to `f(n-1)`, and then that result is passed as an argument to another call to `f`. This creates a nesting of calls, with each call depending on the result of a deeper recursive call.

### **Summary of Recursion Types**

1. **Direct Recursion**:
    
    - A function calls itself directly in its own body.
    - Simple and straightforward, but could lead to inefficiencies if not optimized.
2. **Tail Recursion**:
    
    - The recursive call is the last operation in the function.
    - More efficient because many compilers can optimize it (tail call optimization).
3. **Non-Tail Recursion**:
    
    - There is additional work to do after the recursive call returns.
    - Typically requires more memory due to maintaining the call stack.
4. **Indirect Recursion**:
    
    - A function calls another function, which then calls the original function, forming a cycle of function calls.
5. **Nested Recursion**:
    
    - A recursive call involves calling another recursive function, leading to a multi-level chain of recursive calls.
