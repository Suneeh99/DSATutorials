# **Doubly Linked List**

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node contains:

1. **Prev**: A reference to the previous node in the list.
2. **Next**: A reference to the next node in the list.

Key properties:

- **Head's prev** is `null`.
- **Tail's next** is `null`.

### **Circular Doubly Linked List**

A circular doubly linked list connects the last node to the first node:

- **Head's prev** points to the tail.
- **Tail's next** points to the head.

## **Operations on Doubly Linked List**

### **Insert Value at a Specific Location**

To insert a node (`new`) after a `current` node:

1. Update the previous node of `current.next`:
    
    ```java
    current.next.prev = new;
    ```
    
2. Point the `next` of the `new` node to `current.next`:
    
    ```java
    new.next = current.next;
    ```
    
3. Point the `prev` of the `new` node to `current`:
    
    ```java
    new.prev = current;
    ```
    
4. Update `current.next` to point to the `new` node:
    
    ```java
    current.next = new;
    ```

### **Insert at the Beginning**

Steps to insert a `new` node at the start of the list:

1. Update the `next` of the previous tail:
    
    ```java
    head.prev.next = new;
    ```
    
2. Point `new.next` to the current head:
    
    ```java
    new.next = head;
    ```
    
3. Point `new.prev` to the previous tail:
    
    ```java
    new.prev = head.prev;
    ```
    
4. Update the current headâ€™s `prev` to the `new` node:
    
    ```java
    head.prev = new;
    ```
    
5. Set the `new` node as the head:
    
    ```java
    head = new;
    ```
    

---

### **Delete at a Specific Location**

To delete a node at a specific location:

1. Update `current.next` to skip the next node:
    
    ```java
    current.next = current.next.next;
    ```
    
2. Update the `prev` of the new `current.next` to point back to `current`:
    
    ```java
    current.next.prev = current;
    ```
    

---

### **Delete at the Beginning**

Steps to delete the head node:

1. Update the `next` of the previous tail to point to the new head:
    
    ```java
    head.prev.next = head.next;
    ```
    
2. Update the `prev` of the new head to point to the previous tail:
    
    ```java
    head.next.prev = head.prev;
    ```
    

---

### **Delete at the End**

To delete the tail node:

1. Update the `prev` of the second-to-last node to `null`:
    
    ```java
    current.next.prev = current.prev;
    ```
    
2. Update the `next` of the second-to-last node to point to `null`:
    
    ```java
    current.prev.next = current.next;
    ```
    

Alternatively, without traversal:

1. Update the `prev` of the head to skip the current tail:
    
    ```java
    head.prev = head.prev.prev;
    ```
    
2. Update the `next` of the new tail to point back to the head:
    
    ```java
    head.prev.next = head;
    ```
    

---

### **Summary**

A doubly linked list is versatile and allows bidirectional traversal. Operations such as insertion and deletion at the beginning, end, or any specific position are efficiently managed by updating the `prev` and `next` pointers. A circular doubly linked list provides seamless navigation between the head and tail, making it suitable for use cases where continuous traversal is needed.
