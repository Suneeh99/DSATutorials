### **Trees**

#### **Representation of Trees**

- Trees can be represented as a **list structure**, where the root node is followed by a list of its subtrees.
    
    - Example:
        
        ```
        A( B ( C ( D ) ) ( E ( F ) ( G ) ) ) ( H ( I ( J ) ( K ) ( L ) ) ( M ) )
        ```
        
- **Node Structure**: Each tree node has:
    
    - **Object**: Useful information or data.
    - **Children**: References or pointers to its child nodes.

---

#### **Optimizing Memory Usage**

- Instead of storing all children in separate pointers, each node maintains:
    - A **left child** pointer (to the leftmost child).
    - A **right sibling** pointer (to the next sibling).

**Example**:

```
Data
Left Child | Right Sibling
```

#### **Tree Diagram Example**

```md
               A
        /    |    |    \
       B      C   D    E
    /   \         |   /  \
    F   G         H  I   J
```

### **Binary Tree Structure**

- A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children.
    - **Left Child**: Points to the left subtree.
    - **Right Child**: Points to the right subtree.

#### **Complete Binary Tree**

- A binary tree is **complete** if:
    1. Every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled.
    2. All nodes are as far left as possible.

**Example**:

```
        A
      /   \
     B     C
    / \   /
   D   E
```

**Properties**:

1. Nodes at each level:
    - Level 0: 20=12^0 = 1
    - Level 1: 21=22^1 = 2
    - Level 2: 22=42^2 = 4
2. Height of the tree: Total number of levels minus one.

---

#### **Full Binary Tree**

- A binary tree is **full** if:
    1. Each non-leaf node has exactly two children.
    2. All leaf nodes are at the same level.

**Example**:

```
        A
      /   \
     B     C
    / \   / \
   D   E F   G
```

**Properties**:

1. At level LL, a full binary tree contains exactly 2L2^L nodes.
2. The total number of nodes in a full binary tree of height hh is 2h+1âˆ’12^{h+1} - 1.

---

#### **Balanced Binary Tree**

- A **balanced binary tree** ensures that:
    1. The height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.

### **Tree Examples**

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:

```
      50
     /   \
   30     70
  / \    /  \
20  40  60   80
```

2. **BST with Additional Nodes**:

```
      40
     /   \
   20     60
  / \    /  \
10  30  50  70
      \
      25
```

3. **General Binary Tree**:

```
       27
    /       \
  14         35
 /  \       /   \
10   19    31   42
/ \   / \
9  11 15 21
```

### **Key Points**

- Trees are essential for organizing data hierarchically.
- Binary trees are the foundation of efficient search and sort algorithms.
- Special types like complete, full, and balanced trees provide optimized structures for specific applications.
